About Us

Our love of brioche began in 1945 in a French boulangerie, where our family began creating delicious artisanal brioche. Nestled in the countryside of western France, we passed down our family recipes, mastering the perfect brioche: a soft, fluffy, slightly sweet bread that brings joy with every bite.

For four generations, we’ve been baking wholesome brioche breads in France and today, we are delighted to bring our classic French bread to households across Australia. Our original family recipes remain true, and so does our passion for our craft, which inspires every brioche we bake today.",False,,,,

Nestled in the countryside of western France, we passed down our family recipes, mastering the perfect brioche: a soft, fluffy, slightly sweet bread that brings joy with every bite. For four generations, we’ve been baking wholesome brioche breads in France and today, we are delighted to bring our classic French bread to households across Australia. Our original family recipes remain true, and so does our passion for our craft, which inspires every brioche we bake today.</p>",False,,,,

About Us

Our love of brioche began in 1945 in a French boulangerie, where our family began creating delicious artisanal brioche. Nestled in the countryside of western France, we passed down our family recipes, mastering the perfect brioche: a soft, fluffy, slightly sweet bread that brings joy with every bite.

For four generations, we’ve been baking wholesome brioche breads in France and today, we are delighted to bring our classic French bread to households across Australia. Our original family recipes remain true, and so does our passion for our craft, which inspires every brioche we bake today.",False,,,,
